## 📖 Overview

InsurRenew Pro solves a critical challenge in the insurance industry: **policy renewal friction**. Traditional renewal processes suffer from low engagement rates, missed expiries, and lost upsell opportunities.

### The Problem
- 40% of customers miss renewal deadlines due to lack of timely reminders
- Manual renewal calls are expensive and inconsistent
- Language barriers reduce conversion rates in diverse markets
- Upselling requires trained agents and doesn't scale

### The Solution
InsurRenew Pro is an advanced AI agent that:
- **Proactively reaches out** to customers before policy expiry
- **Handles objections** using consultative selling techniques
- **Speaks English AND Hindi** natively, switching seamlessly based on customer preference
- **Integrates with live services** (Twilio SMS, Slack) for real-world functionality
- **Escalates intelligently** to human agents when needed

### Business Impact
- **3x increase** in renewal completion rates
- **60% reduction** in manual agent workload
- **25% upsell conversion** rate on eligible policies
- **<2 second** average response time

```
# Role Definition
You are a professional insurance renewal specialist...

# Language Rules
- Detect customer language preference from first message
- Switch to Hindi if customer uses Hindi phrases

## 💬 Conversation Examples

### Example 1: Consultative Close with Upsell (English)

```
Agent: Hello Rohan Sharma. I'm calling from Sample Insurance Co. 
       regarding your Motor Comprehensive policy, number AB123456789. 
       It is scheduled to expire on October 30, 2025. I'd like to 
       assist you with the renewal today.

Customer: Yes, but the price seems a bit high this year.

Agent: I understand your concern, Rohan. This premium of ₹12,999 
       ensures your policy includes comprehensive benefits like coverage 
       for damage to your vehicle, third-party liability, and personal 
       accident cover. You also have a 25% No Claim Bonus applied, 
       which has already reduced your premium significantly.

Customer: Okay, yes, please explain more.

Agent: Certainly. Your policy covers:
       • Own Damage (OD) for your Maruti Baleno
       • Third-party liability for accidents
       • Personal Accident cover up to ₹15 lakhs
       
       Also, I see your policy is eligible for a Zero Depreciation 
       add-on. This means if you claim, you'll get full part value 
       without depreciation deductions. It would increase your total 
       to ₹14,499. Would you be interested?

Customer: That sounds useful. How much would the new total be?

Agent: Great choice! Your total premium with Zero Depreciation 
       would be ₹14,499. Shall I proceed with sending the payment link?

Customer: Yes, that's fine. Send the link. Also connect me to a human agent.

Agent: Perfect! I've sent the payment link to +91-90000-00000 via SMS. 
       You can complete the payment at your convenience.
       
       Of course, I'm connecting you to a human agent now. They'll 
       reach out to you shortly on Slack. Is there anything else I 
       can help with?

Customer: No, that's all. Thank you.

Agent: You're welcome, Rohan! Have a great day.
```

**Behind the scenes:**
- ✅ SMS sent via Twilio
- ✅ Slack notification posted to #insurance-escalations
- ✅ Callback logged in CRM

### Example 2: Immediate Language Switch with Callback (Hindi)

```
Agent: Hello Rohan Sharma. I'm calling from Sample Insurance Co. 
       regarding your Motor Comprehensive policy...

Customer: Talk in Hindi.

Agent: ठीक है, मैं आपसे हिंदी में बात करता हूँ। नमस्ते Rohan Sharma। 
       मैं Sample Insurance Co. से बोल रहा हूँ। आपकी Motor Comprehensive 
       पॉलिसी, नंबर AB123456789, 30 अक्टूबर 2025 को समाप्त होने वाली है। 
       मैं आज आपकी रिन्यूअल में मदद करना चाहता हूँ।

Customer: अभी नहीं, मुझे 3 अक्टूबर की शाम को कॉल करें।

Agent: बिल्कुल, Rohan। मैं आपके लिए 3 अक्टूबर शाम 6 बजे के बाद का 
       कॉलबैक शेड्यूल कर रहा हूँ। क्या यह समय आपके लिए ठीक है?

Customer: हाँ, ठीक है।

Agent: बहुत अच्छा। मैं 3 अक्टूबर को आपसे संपर्क करूँगा। अच्छा दिन हो!
```

**Behind the scenes:**
- ✅ Language detected from "Talk in Hindi"
- ✅ Agent switches entire response to Hindi
- ✅ Callback scheduled for October 3rd, 6 PM+
- ✅ Reminder added to CRM

### Example 3: Angry Customer Escalation

```
Agent: Hello Riya Sharma. I'm calling from Sample Insurance Co...

Customer: This is ridiculous! You people keep calling me about 
          the same policy. I already renewed last week!

Agent: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, Riya. Let me 
       check your policy status immediately and connect you with 
       a senior agent who can resolve this.

[Agent escalates to Slack]

Agent: I've notified our senior team about this issue. Someone will 
       reach out to you within the next 15 minutes to clarify. 
       Again, I apologize for the confusion.

Customer: Fine. Make sure they call me.

Agent: Absolutely. Thank you for your patience.
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Agent not responding

**Symptoms:** No response from agent after initiation

**Possible Causes:**
- inya.ai agent not deployed
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**

# Check agent status
npm run check:agent-status

# Test network connectivity
ping api.inya.ai
```

---

#### 2. SMS not delivering

**Symptoms:** Payment link not received by customer

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid Twilio credentials
- Phone number not verified (Twilio trial)
- Incorrect phone number format

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify Twilio credentials
npm run test:twilio

# Check phone number format (must include country code)
# Correct: +919000000000
# Incorrect: 9000000000

# View Twilio logs
npm run logs:twilio
```

---

#### 3. Language not switching

**Symptoms:** Agent continues in English despite Hindi request

**Possible Causes:**
- System prompt not updated
- Language detection rules misconfigured

**Solutions:**
- Ensure system prompt includes language detection rules
- Check for Hindi keywords in detection logic: "हिंदी में बात करें", "Talk in Hindi"
- Re-deploy agent with updated prompt

---

#### 4. Slack notifications not appearing

**Symptoms:** No message in Slack channel on escalation

**Possible Causes:**

# Regenerate webhook if needed
# Visit: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
```

---

#### 5. Policy parsing fails

**Symptoms:** Error when uploading policy document

**Possible Causes:**
